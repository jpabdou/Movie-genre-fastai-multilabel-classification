This was a side project I started in 2021 in which I used movie poster images and IMDB data (all data and images were downloaded from the kaggle dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster). The purpose of this project was to identify the genres of movies from their posters as a means to get familiar with fastai's dataloader and learner functions. Below is the image of the IMDB data table used to identify genres using the poster filenames, which are named by "imdbID."

Originally, I had intended to identify posters by their first genre by sorting posters into genre directories and using the filepath for labelling each image. I programmed a Python script that matched the IMDB ID filename to the corresponding genre in the Kaggle dataset csv and sorted each poster image to their corresponding first genre directory. However, multiple genres turned out to be listed in alphabetical order, which led to the first genre model overfitting for "dramas" and "comedies" as shown in the confusion matrix below. This makes sense as these terms can be broadly applied to many stories compared to other genres that start with "A" or "B" ("family comedy", "war drama", "romance drama", "romance comedy",etc.)

This requires a muli-label classification model to account for more genres than the first-listed one. Reattempting this project, I programmed a Python script that labelled each poster image with their corresponding genre cell in the Kaggle dataset csv. I trained a multi-label ResNet-34 model on 10 cycles with following results:

The classification model has a multi-label accuracy of 91% with a 50% threshold. As a result, the multilabel classifier shows high accuracy in determining at least one of the genres of movie posters (actual genres on top and ML-classified genres on bottom). This work fulfilled the purpose to familiarize myself with the workflow for machine learning training using fastai's functions.
